# pygvb

This is a pyscf-based implementation of the Generalized Valence Bond (GVB) theory,
with invaluable advice and assistance from [@1234zou](https://github.com/1234zou) and
[@hebrewsnabla](https://github.com/hebrewsnabla).
The implementation is based on [Bobrowicz 1977](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4757-0887-5_4).
